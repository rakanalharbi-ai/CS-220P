# CS220P - MOI Data Analytics

## Forking and Cloning

This is the framework for the 'CS220P - MOI Data Analytics' lab. 
If you are a student you should 

1. fork this repo, 
2. make YOUR repo private, 
3. share YOUR repo with us (see contacts below), and 
4. clone YOUR copy of the repo.

Each assignment will have its own folder that contains instructions (a readme file) and a stand-alone program.
You can use the repository to save your progress and to share code with us.
When the deadline is approaching commit your solution and a report document.

## Compiling and Running the Framework

*information about installing git, python versions, pip install specific libraries, etc here* <br />
We recommend using Visual Studio Code as an IDE.
If you want to use a different operating system or IDE, you will have to port parts of the code yourself.
